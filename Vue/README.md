# DevExtreme Vue TagBox - Getting Started 
 
This repository stores the code examples of the Vue TagBox component for the [Getting Started with TagBox](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/TagBox/Getting_Started_with_TagBox/) tutorial. The TagBox is an editor that allows users to select multiple items from a drop-down list. This tutorial explains how to add a TagBox to a page, populate the drop-down list, allow users to search through it, and log the selected item data to the console.
